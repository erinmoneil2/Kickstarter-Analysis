Looking at the Parent Category and Subcategory charts above, the theatre campaigns are the most common types of compaigns, with plays have the most success when conducting crowdfunding campaigns. If you look at the Outcomes Based on Launch Date, the most successful campaigns that were conducted began in May-June and also lasted only one-two months long. In addition, based on descriptive statistics, campaigns that were the most successful only had a goal of $5,000, whereas campaigns that failed had a higher goal of closer to $10,000 or higher. A recommendation for Louise is to lower her campaign goals to a goal of $5-7,000 and plan for her campaign start date in May.
