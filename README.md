# Kickstarting with Excel 

## Overview of Kickstarter Analysis 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise plan a crowdfunding campaign for her upcoming play Fever. She has planned for a goal of $10,000, and this analysis will help her to decide whether her planned goal amount is more or less likely to be successful, as well as when is the best time throughout the year to receive the most participation and contributors to her campaign. 
## Analysis and Challanges

### Analysis of Theatre Outcomes Based on Launch Date 
To start out the challenge, I used =YEARS(S:S) to populate all of the years from the ‘Date Created Conversion’ column to column U. After adding the column displaying ‘years’ in the Kickstarter file, I created a Pivot table in another sheet. In order to find the Theatre Outcomes Based on Launch Date, I used ‘Parent Category’ and ‘Years’ as a filters, placed ‘outcomes’ into columns, ‘Date Created Conversions’ to rows, and ‘outcomes’ to values. Then I filtered the parent category to only display “theatre” campaigns. This allows us to see all of the theatre campaigns that have been successful, failed, or canceled within the dataset.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals 
 found this section to be far more challenging using the =COUNTIFS function. After creating the required row/column format, I began by creating a base formula of =COUNTIFS(Kickstarter!D:D,”<1000”,Kickstarter!F:F,”successful”,Kickstarter!R:R,”plays”). This base formula takes row D ‘goal’ and finds all goals that are less than $1000, the second criteria filters only those that are successful, and then filters all of those that are plays. Moving down the rows, I then adjusted each of the formulas to add in the addition criteria of Kickstarter!D:D,”>=1000”, Kickstarter!D:D,”<=4999”. This sets a range for the filter to find any goal amount between those numbers. I then adjusted the formulas down the row according the appropriate goal amount. Moving across the columns, I used the same formulas that I used for column B, but changed ‘successful’ to read ‘failed’ or ‘canceled’ for each appropriate column. The total projects used the =SUM() formula for Columns B, C and D. For each percentage used an =B2/E2, =C2/E2, and =D2/E2 to receive the formula for percent successful, failed or canceled.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered 
In the Theatre Outcomes by Launch Date deliverable, I had difficulty in changing the Row labels on the pivot chart to read months instead of full day/month/year. I did a lot of trial and error in moving around the different categories to rows and columns. Eventually I found the solution by right clicking on the row and using the “group” function to group all of the data by months which resulted in the pivot table  displaying JAN-DEC. In the Outcomes Based on Goals, The first =COUNTIFS formula was simpler than the rest and it took some time to find the correct one for the rest of the row. When I placed the condition of <= after the ‘successful’ condition, I would get an error. It took some trial and error to find the correct placement of all of the conditions within this section. 

## Results 
1. One conclusion that can be drawn from the Theatre Outcomes Based on Launch Date is that the most successful campaigns were launched between May and June. Even though May and June had the most successful campaigns, I do think that it is important to note that the failure rate across the board is relatively proportional to the successful campaigns. In order to help define why May and June are more successful that other months, I think it would be beneficial to create a table or chart depicting which type of theatre subcategory were most successful in order to further explain whether May-June is more successful for plays versus musicals or spaces. Another conclusion is that campaign funding tends to have a downward trend towards with some of the lowest funding in September. This could be due to the end of the fiscal year and contributors having fiscal year budgets and not being able to provide as much funding towards the end of the fiscal year.
2. Outcomes Based on Goals produces a few outcomes. One being that that most successful plays tend to have a goal of less that $5000. While there are a few play campaigns that were successful with higher goals between $35000-$45000, there were only roughly 6 plays within that category and can be considered as outliers and the likelihood of being successful if 67%.
3. I think one of the limitations of this dataset is that the information is very widespread with the majority of the campaigns being under the $10000 range and only some (less than 75) are above that. If you are only looking at the Outcomes Based on Goals line chart and see only percentages, it would look like plays that have goals between $35000 and $45000 have a very high success rate, but the number of plays that had those goals and were successful was only 4, compared to the number of successful plays between $1000 and $4999 was 388. 
4. In order to create more defined analysis I would create the same tables/charts for Theatre Outcomes by Date and Outcomes Based on Goals, but filter them based on location. A high successful rate for theatre or play campaigns in Great Britain could be significantly different from theatre campaigns in the United States. We would need to know where Louise is planning on campaigning and be able to better define what the success rate is for those locations.
